# Synthetix Protocol Overview

Synthetix is a liquidity provisioning protocol that enables the creation and trading of synthetic assets (synths) backed by staked Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX). These synthetic assets provide users with exposure to various real-world assets without holding the actual underlying asset.

---

## Core Functionality

### Synthetic Assets (Synths)
- Synths are tokenized representations of real-world assets such as:
  - Fiat currencies
  - Commodities
  - Stocks
  - Cryptocurrencies
- Synths allow users to trade and gain exposure to various assets seamlessly.

### How It Works
1. **Collateralization with SNX**  
   - SNX tokens are staked in a smart contract as collateral.  
   - Locked SNX enables the issuance of synthetic assets.  

2. **Pooled Collateral Model**  
   - Synths are supported by a pooled collateral model, enabling direct conversions between different synths via smart contracts.  
   - This eliminates the need for counterparties in trades.  


## Key Areas of Synthetix  

### 1. The Synthetix Protocol  
- A **suite of smart contracts** designed to provision liquidity.  
- Works alongside Synthetix Governance to enable financial derivative products.  

### 2. The Synthetix Staking Interface  
- A **web interface** that simplifies interaction with:  
  - Synthetix Staking.  
  - Other Synthetix ecosystem products.  

### 3. Synthetix Governance  
- A **representative council system** that oversees the protocol.  
- Governed by four staker-elected councils:  
  1. **Spartan Council**: Oversees protocol decisions.  
  2. **Treasury Council**: Manages protocol funds.  
  3. **Ambassador Council**: Handles community relationships.  
  4. **Grants Council**: Supports ecosystem development.  

### 4. Synthetix Partners & Integrators  
- **Protocols integrating Synthetix products**:  
  - Utilize Synthetix liquidity for user-facing applications.  
  - Cover a wide range of use cases, generating trading fees for SNX stakers.  

### 5. The Greater Synthetix Ecosystem  
- Includes **additional protocols** closely tied to the Synthetix Community.  
- While not directly using Synthetix liquidity, they maintain strong relationships and shared goals with the Synthetix ecosystem.
  
# System Overview and Contract Review
## 1 basesynthetix.sol 
### System Overview
The BaseSynthetix contract is a foundational component of the Synthetix protocol, responsible for managing core token functionalities and integrating with other system components. The Synthetix protocol enables the creation and exchange of synthetic assets (Synths), providing exposure to various assets without direct ownership. This contract incorporates key mechanisms for token management, exchange operations, collateralization, and integration with other protocol components via the MixinResolver.
### Contract Review
The contract uses pragma solidity ^0.5.16, (line 1) which is outdated and potentially insecure. It is recommended to upgrade to Solidity ^0.8.x for enhanced security features like automatic overflow/underflow checks though the contract made use of safemath library.
